# On-Chain Freelancer Reputation System

## ðŸ“œ Description

This project provides a decentralized, on-chain reputation system for freelancers, built on the Aptos blockchain using the Move programming language. The smart contract allows freelancers to create a personal reputation profile that is stored securely and transparently on the blockchain.

Clients can interact with the contract to submit ratings (from 1 to 5) for freelancers and mark projects as complete. The contract automatically calculates and updates key metrics, including:
* **Total Rating:** The sum of all ratings received.
* **Total Reviews:** The total number of reviews submitted.
* **Completed Projects:** A count of all successfully completed projects.

The system also includes public view functions that allow anyone to query a freelancer's average rating and the total number of completed projects, fostering a transparent and trust-based ecosystem.

## ðŸ”­ Vision

The vision of this project is to create a **portable, censorship-resistant, and universally verifiable reputation standard for the freelance economy**. In the current Web2 landscape, a freelancer's hard-earned reputation is often locked within a single platform (like Upwork or Fiverr) and is subject to the platform's opaque rules and potential biases.

By moving reputation on-chain, we empower freelancers with true ownership of their work history and credibility. This system aims to become a foundational layer for Web3 freelancing, enabling a future where a freelancer's reputation can be seamlessly accessed and trusted across various dApps, DAOs, and decentralized job marketplaces without relying on a central intermediary.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope

This foundational module can be extended with a variety of features to create a comprehensive and robust freelance ecosystem. Potential future enhancements include:

* **Project & Milestone Management:** Adding structs and functions to manage project details, milestones, and deliverables directly on-chain.
* **Decentralized Dispute Resolution:** Implementing a mechanism, possibly involving staking and third-party arbitrators, to resolve disputes between clients and freelancers in a fair and transparent manner.
* **Skill Endorsements:** Allowing clients to endorse freelancers for specific skills (e.g., "Move," "Solidity," "UI/UX Design"), creating a more detailed and verifiable skill profile.
* **Reputation NFTs:** Minting a dynamic NFT for each freelancer that visually represents their reputation, achievements, and skill set. This "Soulbound" token could serve as a Web3 resume.

* **Integration with Decentralized Identity (DID):** Linking on-chain reputation to a freelancer's decentralized identity to build a more holistic and portable professional profile.
* **Privacy Features:** Incorporating zero-knowledge proofs to allow for private reviews or confidential project details while still contributing to the public reputation score.
* **DAO & dApp Integration:** Creating a simple API or SDK that allows Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and other dApps to easily query a freelancer's reputation score before hiring them for a bounty or a long-term role.
